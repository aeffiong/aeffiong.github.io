        <p>Hi, my name is Atim Effiong, and I am a Utah native who loves fitness and my
        dog Butters. I have always had an interest in building things but wasn't sure 
        in what capacity. I have found that coding has a been a great outlet for me to create.
        </p>

        <p>I grew up in Ogden and a attended a small school where I played soccer, basketball,
        and ran track. To this day, I still have 2 state records for track. One in the 100m dash
        and another one in the 4x100m relay race. I attended the University of Utah and received a 
        Bachelor's in Exercise and Sport Science with minors in both Nutrtion, and Human Development.
        I then attended the University of Arizona where I received a Master's in Public Health. I moved
        back to Utah after completely my degree in 2013. Since then I have been a study coordinar where 
        I data analysis for large research study database, started an online business personal training,
        and currently work in the employee wellness sector.
