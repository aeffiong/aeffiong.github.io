                        Hi, my name is Atim Effiong, and I am a full stack developer with a Master’s Degree in Public Health and 6 years academic
                        research experience. I am currently pursuing education in a full stack MERN web development program.
                        I have always had an interest in building things but wasn't sure in what capacity. I have found that
                        coding has a been a great opportunity for me to create.

                    <p>
                        I attended the University of Utah and received a Bachelor's in Exercise and Sport Science with minors in both Nutrition,
                        and Human Development. I then attended the University of Arizona where I received a Master's in Public
                        Health.

                    <p>
                        Since then, I have been a study coordinar where I conducted data analysis for large research studies, and currently work
                        in the employee wellness sector. My vision is to combine my healthcare background and experience
                        with web development to provide a better user platforms and experience for clients, patients, and
                        researchers.
